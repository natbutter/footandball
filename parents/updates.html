<h3>Term 1,2026 Updates</h3>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Welcome to our additional Academy-wide communication channel. This page is intended for more 'long-winded' updates.</p>

<p> Thanks again for expressing your interest in remaining with Foot and Ball Academy for the commencement of our 4th year in operation, 2026.</p>

<p> As we continue to grow, the point of 'equilibrium' gets closer, whereby the constant term-to-term changes will begin to slow, 
  and some consistency from our end will begin to (finally) emerge. In saying that (lol) here are the important changes starting in 2026:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Foot and Ball Academy will be the focus for Association/Grassroots/ non-competitive players only. 
    All players that achieve a position inside a full-time junior program i.e. JDL, or some kind of full time Academy / Academy League will no longer be able to attend from 2026.</li>
  <li>We are introducing a new ‘third’ component and coaching service to the business. <strong>GameIQ</strong>, one night per week, will focus on ‘big field’ games i.e. 7 v 7 or 8 v 8, etc 
    with <strong>multiple coaches involved</strong>, helping the players better understand 
    the proper rules, basic tactics, and formations on the ‘big’ field, where they would otherwise be lost in the ‘wilderness’ on a Saturday. 
    This will be available to all WHITE and NAVY players in Term 1, 2026 (pilot run).</li>
  <li>This expands our Academy coaching pillars to three. ‘Dry’ training (no tackling, ball work only), contextualised training (small-sided games), 
    and now GameIQ. We hope this affords you and your child the necessary framework to service all the major areas in player development until you’re ready to take the next ‘step.’</li>
  <li><strong>Session colours</strong> were a big hit from my side. Much easier to manage and coach. 2026 will see the Academy adopt a more ‘fluid’ and ‘uneven’ approach to assigning your child a colour. 
    This is inspired directly from the latest trends emerging out of actual official Academies e.g. CAT 1’s in the UK or Melbourne City FC, here in Oz. They term it ‘IDP’ or individual player development plan.</li>
  <li>As there are now three services on offer from the Academy (eventually) a player ‘could (but rare)’ have three different colours assigned for that term, 
    depending on their individual development journey (majority one or two). We hope this 'sensitivity' to player development yields better individual long-term results.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>next text message I send out to you all</strong> will contain the timetable, enrolment form and assigned colour(s) for your child(ren). A (made-up) example is included below:</p>
<p> (Example START) </p>
<p> <em>Welcome back to Term 1, 2026. Your assigned colours for this term (only) are:</em> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> <em>Training: White</em> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> <em>GameIQ: Navy</em> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> <em>Skills:White</em> </p>
<p> <em>Timetable (please download to your phone): (link TBC)</em> </p>
<p> <em>Enrolment Form: Link</em> </p>
<p> <em>Any questions or concerns, let me know!</em> </p>
<p> <em>Have a great Christmas break!</em> </p>
<p> (Example END) </p>
<p> That’s it from me! These are all the major updates, starting  first day of 2026. As always, any questions, let me know. I hope the text + timetable are clear enough to guide you all.</p>
<p> Finally, your support, and desire to prioritise the Academy is the reason we can expand like this. So, thank you, again for all of it so far! </p>
<p> Otherwise, see you on the fields! Coach Nick </p>
