					<h3>Coach</h3>
					<p>Coaches must promote a fair session through discipline for all players.</p>
					<p>Coaches will always emphasize the importance of personal growth and improvement over
						winning.</p>
					<p>Coaches may keep score of ‘mini games’ for educational purposes only.</p>
					<p>Coaches and staff must respect the rights, dignity and worth of every person and treat each player equally
						within the context of the sport.</p>
					<p>
						Coaches and staff must place the safety and wellbeing of each player above all other considerations
						including the development of performance.</p>
					<p>
						Coaches must work to develop an appropriate working relationship with each player based on mutual trust and
						respect.</p>
					<p>Coaches must not exert undue influence to obtain personal benefit or reward.</p>
					<p>Coaches must encourage and guide players to accept responsibility for their own behaviour and performance.
					</p>
					<p>Coaches must ensure that the activities they direct, or advocate are appropriate for the age, experience,
						maturity, and ability of players.</p>
					<p>Coaches will clarify with players (and parents) exactly what is expected from them and what they are
						entitled to expect from their coach.</p>
					<p>Coaches must always promote the positive aspects of the sport (e.g., fair play) and never condone
						violations of the laws of the game, behaviour contrary to the spirit of the laws of the game, or relevant
						rules and regulations, or the use of prohibited substances or techniques.</p>
					<h3>Disciplinary Procedures</h3>
					<p>
						In the case of serious misconduct where the behaviour of the player or parent is deemed a risk to the safety
						or enjoyment of other players or staff, Foot and Ball Academy reserves the right to immediately suspend that
						player from continuing as an Academy member.</p>
					<p> More generally, where a player is found to have beached the standards of player behaviour outlined above the following
						procedure will generally apply:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Verbal warning:</b> a verbal warning will be given to the player to cease the behaviour in question.
							We will inform player of the next step if the behaviour continues to occur.</li>
						<li><b>Behaviour continues:</b> the player will be issued a second warning along with a meeting with their parent or guardian to discuss
							any potential issues or problems.</li>
						<li><b>CA third and final breach:</b> the player will be sent home with parent/guardian. A decision will be made on
							whether the player can continue in the program or have his/her registration cancelled. In these instances,
							no refund of fees will apply.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>
						Parental Responsibilities
					</h3>
					<p>In cases where parents have been deemed to have acted in a way contrary to our values and/or have breached
						their responsibilities, the same procedure outlined for players will be followed.</p>
					<p>Parents should be aware that in such cases their child’s place in the Academy may be withdrawn.</p>
					<p>If a player’s place is withdrawn for disciplinary reasons relating to parental behaviour, there will be no
						refund of fees paid.</p>
					<h2>Complaints</h2>
					<p>Despite our commitment to a providing a fulfilling experience and the best intentions of coaches, players,
						and parents, at Foot and Ball Academy, sometimes misunderstandings or disputes occur. We also realise from
						time-to-time players may have questions or concerns about a range of football issues.</p>
					<p>We strongly support and encourage players to raise any questions or concerns directly with their coach
						after training or at another appropriate time.</p>
					<p>
						We also support parents raising concerns with us in an appropriate manner. If a situation warrants a parent
						raising a concern.</p>
					<p>Some simple rules will ensure parents, players and coaches will gain the most from their interaction:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Never look to have a conversation with a coach on the pitch at training – the training field is for
							coaches and players only.</li>
						<li>Similarly, straight after sessions is not an appropriate place or time to have a private discussion,
							<b>especially if emotions are high.</b>
						</li>
						<li>A 24 hour “cool down” period before formulating a complaint is requested.</li>
						<li>Correspondence via email or phone call outside of training hours is highly
							recommended.</li>
						<li>If the situation cannot be swiftly resolved via a phone call or scheduled meeting,
							then escalation may be required.</li>
						<li>This will include moving the conversation to permanent email correspondence to
							maintain a succinct and accurate “log” of the dispute’s evolution.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>These communication guidelines are a practical way for players and families to demonstrate
						respect for our staff, your children, and the values on which we build our program.</p>
					<p>At Foot and Ball Academy we are confident in the service we provide, as such, we strongly believe most
						complaints can be resolved by a good old fashion chat.</p>
