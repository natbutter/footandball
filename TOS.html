In the case of serious misconduct where the behaviour of the player or parent is deemed a risk to the safety or enjoyment of other players or staff, Foot and Ball Academy reserves the right to immediately suspend that player from continuing as an Academy member.
Where a player is found to have beached the standards of player behaviour outlined above the following procedure will generally apply:

Parental Responsibilities
In cases where parents have been deemed to have acted in a way contrary to our values and/or have breached their responsibilities, the same procedure outlined for players will be followed.
Parents should be aware that in such cases their child’s place in the Academy may be withdrawn.
If a player’s place is withdrawn for disciplinary reasons relating to parental behaviour, there will be no refund of fees paid.
Complaints
Despite our commitment to a providing a fulfilling experience and the best intentions of coaches, players, and parents, at Foot and Ball Academy, sometimes misunderstandings or disputes occur. We also realise from time-to-time players may have questions or concerns about a range of football issues.
We strongly support and encourage players to raise any questions or concerns directly with their coach after training or at another appropriate time.
We also support parents raising concerns with us in an appropriate manner. If a situation warrants a parent raising a concern.
Some simple rules will ensure parents, players and coaches will gain the most from their interaction:
- Never look to have a conversation with a coach on the pitch at training – the training field is for coaches and players only.
- Similarly, straight after sessions is not an appropriate place or time to have a private discussion, especially if emotions are high.
- A 24 hour “cool down” period before formulating a complaint is requested.
- Correspondence via email or phone call outside of training hours is highly
recommended.
- If the situation cannot be swiftly resolved via a phone call or scheduled meeting,
then escalation may be required.
- This will include moving the conversation to permanent email correspondence to
maintain a succinct and accurate “log” of the dispute’s evolution.
These communication guidelines are a practical way for players and families to demonstrate
respect for our staff, your children, and the values on which we build our program.

At Foot and Ball Academy we are confident in the service we provide, as such, we strongly believe most complaints can be resolved by a good old fashion chat.
