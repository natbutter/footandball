						<p class="lead">
							Our core programs run according to the school terms. 10-week ‘curriculums’ designed to afford us the time to
						focus on individual long-term player development.
						Our curriculums are 'mirrored' right through the Academy. i.e. The U7 - U8 session design will be the same as the U11 - U12 on that night.

						<b>U7's - U12's:</b> A typical term follows a rotational timetable, covering five main modules. (1) Dribbling and Ball Mastery (2) Attacking (3) Passing and Ball Control
						(4) Possession (5) Defending. We believe mastering each of these modules best prepares the player for their teenager years when tactics and performance based 11-aside games become the primary focus during player development. </p>  


					<h3> Pricing and Player Commitments </h3>
					<p class="lead">
						Pricing can vary slightly term-to-term. It's best to check our Facebook page for the latest term's pricing. </p>
					<p class="lead">
						All term programs have a minimum commitment of 1 session per week for that term i.e., 10 sessions. </p>
					<p class="lead">
						If a player wants to join after the term has started then it is still a minimum commitment
						of 1 session per week for the remainder of weeks in that school term (pro-rata concept).</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Players are to select a minimum of one time slot per week according to their age group.
						Ages are determined based on the players age as of December EOY.</p>
		
					<h3>Joining Fees and Uniform Fees</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						<b>None!</b> At Foot and Ball Academy we believe our <b>no joining fee and no uniform fee</b> is a financial advantage in
						this market space. We pride ourselves on having no additional fees beyond payment of the players direct
						footballing education.
						We strive to provide affordable access to our services as reasonably possible. Player improvement is truly
						at the foundation of Foot and Ball Academy.
