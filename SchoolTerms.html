							Our core programs run according to the school terms. 10-week ‘curriculums’ designed to afford us the time to
						focus on long-term player development.
						These programs give us the opportunity to get to know the player and better identify their strengths and
						weaknesses with the ball.

						<b>U7's - U8's:</b> A typical term curriculum has approximately a 70/30 split. 60-70% of our 10-week term sessions are spent working on 1v1 related exercises, 
						ensuring the individual player is on the ball for the maximum amount of time.
						E.g., dribbling, ball mastery, defending, tricks and turns, as well as space utilisation when attacking.
						The other 30-40% of our allocated term sessions focus on passing and all it’s aspects. This latter component of the curriculum has a 2 v 1’s and 3 v 2’s flavour to it.</p>
					<p class="lead">
						<b>U9's - U12's:</b> A typical term follows a rotational timetable, covering five main modules. (1) Dribbling and Ball Mastery (2) Attacking (3) Passing and Ball Control
						(4) Possession (5) Defending </p>. We believe mastering each of these modules best prepares the player for their teenager years when tactics and 
						performance based 11-aside games become the primary focus during player development.
