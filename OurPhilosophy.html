						From ages ~5 – 12, Foot and Ball Academy sessions maintain <strong>a principal focus on the 1 v
							1 duel.</strong>
						That is, we structure our sessions on primarily improving this area of a player’s game. This is
						motivated by our CORE Philosophy, which follows a popularised philosophy utilised in elite parts
						of
						Europe (not our own):
					</p>

					<p class="lead">
						<em>“Improving the individual player, improves the overall team.”</em> That is, we strive to
						improve the
						technical and mental aspects of an individual player, irrespective of their level.

					<h3 class="text-dark">'Toolbox' Concept.</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						We help players understand they want to build a strong technical ‘toolbox.’ Each key part of their
						body e.g., feet, thighs, chest, and head can be thought of as a ‘tool’ to help them control the ball.
						This incentivises them to develop as many ‘tools’ as possible, helping to problem solve during a
						game. For example, outside left foot, inside left foot, laces of the left foot, soul, or studs of the left
						foot. Alone, that is four tools from just one foot!

						<h2 class="text-dark">Session Guidelines</h2>
						<p class="lead">As a brand-new Academy, you might want to know how we will generally approach a session.
							Below is a guideline for most** sessions for players between the ages of ~5 – 12-year-olds:</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">The Warmup:</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							A classic. Focuses on getting the players active and excited, ready to digest the core message of the
							session e.g., passing or dribbling, etc.</p>
						<p>
							Duration: ~5 minutes
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">Ball Mastery:</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							This is a staple of Foot and Ball Academy. A series of player-and- their-ball manipulation exercises.
							Designed to strengthen the players personal understanding of how they can or might choose to
							move a ball around. E.g., soul taps, toe taps, etc.</p>
						<p>
							Duration: ~10 minutes
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">Fast Feet:</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							This portion of the session is designed to improve the fast feet response of a player. Unopposed
							coordination work. This section does not last long but gets the heart rate up! It involves popular
							tools such as the agility ladder, fast feet through cones, and short sprints (less than 5 m).</p>
						<p>
							Duration: ~5-10 minutes
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">Session theme:</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							Is the focus of the week: passing? Dribbling? Extended Ball Mastery? 1 v 1s? Whatever it may be this
							segment of the session delivers a fun, inclusive set of exercises designed to drive home the key
							message of that week’s focus.</p>
						<p>
							Duration: ~15 minutes
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">The 1 v 1 duels:</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							A very small, 1 on 1 style game. Two small goals. No long shots allowed. No Goalkeepers allowed.
							This concluding aspect of a session allows the players to express themselves and the ideas they have
							learnt or have been learning over previous sessions in a game-like environment. Scorelines are only
							temporarily kept, incentivizing effort. The purpose of the duel is to allow the player access to
							something resembling a real game, without the added pressure. The desired outcome is
							improvement where it matters most, playing!</p>
						<p>
							Duration: always the remainder of a session!
						</p>
						<p>**note: This session guideline is subject to variation, deviation and change if the coach deems it
							necessary.</p>

					<h1 class="text-dark">The Mental Component</h1>
					<p class="lead">
						Often overlooked by society, a sustainable mindset towards playing football is a crucial component
						of our philosophy at Foot and Ball Academy. That is:
					</p>
					<p><em>“First and foremost, calmness and composure on the ball.”</em></p>
					<p>Too often kids’ games are overrun by an over enthusiastic crowd, creating a stressful environment,
						and thus a very subtle, game-related ‘panic’ from the young players.</p>
					<p><em>“Panic is a young player’s first hurdle to overcome in football.”</em></p>
					<p>This very mild ‘panic’ typically expresses itself in subtle ways. Not obvious to the inexperienced.
						Examples include:</p>

					<ol type="1">
						<li>Hiding from the ball during the game.</li>
						<li>Suddenly kicking the ball away at the sound of the crowd yelling.</li>
						<li>Overwhelmed when under pressure from an opponent and kicking the ball away.</li>
						<li>Easily distracted during a game.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>The primary approach we use to overcome this is a simple ideological substitution. We replace the
						concept of <em>winning</em> with that of <em>improving</em>. By doing this, we alter the players mental
						incentives
						when playing. With no leagues or ladders or tables, the player is freed up to focus on their personal
						player improvement.</p>

					<p>**note: we regularly keep scorelines of activities, exercises, and little games throughout a session.
						Scores are not recorded or kept beyond that segment of the session. They are not celebrated at the
						end of it, either. Rather they are used as a gentle, subtle reminder that the goal of the game, long-
						term, is to score.</p>

					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6  align-self-center">
						<h1 class="text-dark">Time</h1>
						<p class="lead">There is ongoing debate over the best approach to developing young players in Australia. One
							aspect
							of the debate that is often neglected is the importance of valuing time.</p>

						<p>
							It is undeniable, one of the lures of the World’s game is its ‘tricky’ nature. The challenges of football
							can only be mastered by one who aims to play with confidence, calmness, and a healthy sense of
							freedom on the field. For that reason, lots of time is required to give young players every chance to
							improve themselves to a level they feel resembles that, with the aim of making the dynamism and
							challenges of the game more enjoyable later in life.
						</p>

						<p>
							At Foot and Ball Academy, respecting the value of time is a foundation of our teaching philosophy.
							Too often, time is wasted, leading to bad habits. From arriving late to sessions, to the hasty
							introduction of in-game management e.g., kicking the ball out under “pressure.” For this reason, we
							not only stress the importance of punctually, but that every player always feels encouraged to make
							constructive mistakes during a session. i.e., taking risk over ‘safe play.’
						</p>

						<p><em>“I would rather see a young player try something they just learnt, make a mistake with it, and
								concede a goal, versus panicking, then booting the ball away, whilst feeling that sense of strategic
								safety. It’s too young for any of that. Leave strategy for later in their life.”</em></p>
