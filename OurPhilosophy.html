              <p>This word gets deployed in the grassroots space... a lot. Typically, it’s an excuse to get all the
                ‘best’ local players together in a super team and ‘win’ things, that’s about it.</p>
              <p>Let’s break down the Academy interpretations of Player development and how it SHOULD express itself:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Experimentation:</b> during the game different moments introduce new challenges, which allows a player to
                  test new ideas.</li>
                <li>Through <b>trial and error</b>, a player can discover what works and what doesn’t work.</li>
                <li>This discovery fuels <b>improvement</b> – refining the process, idea, or player.</li>
                <li>These improvements are the building blocks of personal <b>development</b>.</li>
                <li>This <b>process repeats</b>: as a player develops it opens the door to step (1) i.e. continued experimentation.</li>
              </ol>
              <blockquote>
                <b>The essence of player development is player mistakes.</b> Without mistakes the iterative cycle of trial and
                error cannot fulfill itself. Without mistakes coaches cannot correct and guide. Without mistakes players remain
                stagnant, never evolving into better players.
              </blockquote>
              <p>Summary: Develop: grow or enhance &rarr; Growth requires improvement &rarr; Improvement often comes from
                experimentation &rarr; experimentation involves trial and error &rarr; trial and error leads to insights &rarr;
                Insights lead to further development.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>For this reason, our Academy is very conscious of building a playing environment that incentives the player to
                take risks on the ball during a game and test their ideas without losing confidence in the face of mistakes or opting for the short term perceieved saftey of 'booting it.'</p>
                </blockquote>

            <div class="card-body">
              <p>Based on our understanding of player development defined above we want to recreate a ‘risk-free’ player-focused
                environment when it comes to playing. Below are the following boundaries we put in place that best aids in such
                an environment:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Immediately recover from perceived ‘mistakes.’ The essence of the Academy.</li>
                <li>No winning or losing. No leagues, no ladders, no accolades, no ranks.</li>
                <li>No teams. Players rotate all the time.</li>
                <li>No clearances whatsoever. If a player boots the ball for any reason, especially strategic = penalty against
                  them or their team.</li>
                <li>Always pressure the opponent, never stand off (unless instructed to). Always putting pressure on the ball.
                  Get involved.</li>
                <li>No running back to the goal to ‘pretend’ to goal keep. Very common amongst little kids to run back towards
                  their goal when out of possession. No. No. No.</li>
                <li>Maximum coaching recognition, praise and celebration for trial-and-error efforts on the ball and throughout
                  the game.</li>
                <li>100% effort, all the time. Unless sick or injured.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>We have observed a marked difference in the confidence, genuine enjoyment and appreciation of playing from
                more than enough players attending our Academy to take pride in this environment. The number of parents that
                have approached us to-date with the statement: “my child plays their best football all week at these Academy games”
                further lends support to our coaching model.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Remember: We argue the essence of any ‘development’ model is in-game playing mistakes. Therefore, the playing
                environment must be one that promotes the excessive occurrence of them!</p>
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Without listing the numerous references, you can find online, there appears to be two primary schools of
                thought on the approach to grassroots youth development in football.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>It all starts with the player and the ball. Develop the player technically with the ball, improve the player
                  in the game, and subsequently the team improves.</li>
                <li>It all starts with the player and their “thoughts” of the ball. Precisely, there is a quick ‘decision’ before
                  the player acts on the ball. Therefore, developing the players decision-making skills ultimately improves
                  the player and subsequently the team.</li>
              </ol>
                </blockquote>
              <p>In our experience the two different approaches necessitate two unique session designs.</p>
              <p>If you are seeking out the short of our philosophy: we focus on both approaches until a discretionary point,
                at which time, we switch solely to approach 2 i.e. decision-making.</p>
              <p>We now realise this is the definitive skill to refine within a player, everything else is technique. To build
                competence of a skill such as decision-making during a game takes far longer and far more nuanced coaching
                effort compared to improving a player’s technique on the ball.</p>
              <p>How would the two styles express themselves differently in our sessions?</p>
              <p>Currently, adopting approach (1), i.e. improving-the-player-on-the-ball session looks like:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>50% unopposed ‘dry training.’ i.e. drills and exercises designed with repartition of technique.</li>
                <li>50% opposed 1v1, 2v1, and 2v2 duels.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The very small-sided duels allow for maximum responsibility on the player. This is fastest way for them
                to get involved and get numerous moments on the ball. The idea is the 30 minutes of dry training introduces
                enough muscle memory in the player that they understand ball manipulation then it becomes about expressing
                that under pressure. Which pressure? The opponent.</p>
              <p>Adopting approach (2), i.e. improving-the-players-decision-making session looks like:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Games-only orientated sessions. Escalation in difficulty up until a final game, replicating the actual game
                  ends the session.</li>
                <li>Key concepts are covered in a rotational manner across the week for each session. These include Attacking
                  principles, defending principles, possession principles, duels, and shielding.</li>
                <li>Through each of these games nights we explore on of these major themes and within it heavily focus on
                  the decision-making components that contribute to executing these principles live in play.</li>
              </ul>
