					<p class="lead">
						<em>“Improving the individual player, improves the overall team.”</em> We strive to

					<h3 class="text-dark">'Toolbox' Concept.</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						We help players understand they want to build a strong technical ‘toolbox,’ using each 'allowable' part of their
						body e.g., feet, thighs, chest, when playing football. These can be thought of as ‘tools’ to help the player control, as well as manipulate the ball.
						This incentivises them to develop as many ‘tools’ as possible, helping to problem solve during a
						game e.g. successfully passing a defender. For example, outside left foot, inside left foot, laces of the left foot, soul, or studs of the left
						foot. Alone, that is four tools from just one foot!

						<h2 class="text-dark">Session Guidelines</h2>
						<p class="lead">As a brand-new Academy, we take session structure and participation seriously. 
							At a minimum, if the player absorbs nothing else they will learn that a session has three primary components.
							Below is a guideline for most** sessions for players U6's and above:</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">The Warmup:</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							Imperative. The "warm up" is becoming a hot topic amongst medical professionals. A way of greatly reducing injury in the long-term. 
							The warmup is designed to teach our young players to 'talk to their bodies.' Prepare them for what's coming (training). 
							We focus on getting the players active and excited, ready to digest the core message of the
							session
.</p>
						<p>
							Duration: ~15 minutes
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">Fast Feet:</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							If there is time, this portion of the session is designed to improve the fast feet response of a player as well as their <strong> balance</strong>. Unopposed
							coordination work. This section does not last long but gets the heart rate up! It involves popular
							tools such as the agility ladder, fast feet through cones, and short sprints (less than 5 m).</p>
						<p>
							Duration: ~5-10 minutes
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">Session theme:</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							Is the focus of the week: passing? Dribbling? Defending? Possession? Whatever it may be this
							segment of the session delivers an engaging, inclusive set of exercises designed to drive home the key
							message of that week’s focus.</p>
						<p>
							Duration: ~15-20 minutes
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-dark">The 'ending':</h3>
						<p class="lead">
							If there is time we like to finish with small-sided games, ideally 1 v 1 duels with small goals. Our Academy rules include: no long shots or clearances allowed. 
							Nor, any Goalkeepers. This concluding aspect of a session allows the players to express themselves and the ideas they have
							learnt or have been learning over previous sessions in a game-like environment. There are no scorelines kept. 
							The purpose of the duel is to allow the player access to
							something resembling a real game, without the added pressure. The desired outcome is
							improvement where it matters most, playing!</p>
						<p>
							Duration: always the remainder of a session!
						</p>
						<p>**note: This session guideline is subject to variation, deviation and change if the coach deems it
							necessary.</p>

					<h1 class="text-dark">The Mental Component</h1>
					<p class="lead">
						Often overlooked by society, a sustainable mindset towards playing football is a crucial component
						of our philosophy at Foot and Ball Academy. That is:
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						<em>“First and foremost, calmness and composure on the ball.” - Coach Nick</em></p>
					<p class="lead">
					Too often kids’ games are overrun by an over enthusiastic crowd, creating a stressful environment,
						and thus a very subtle, game-related ‘panic’ from the young players. </p>
					<p class="lead">
						<em>“Panic is a young player’s first hurdle to overcome in football.” - Coach Nick</em></p>
					<p class="lead">
					This very mild ‘panic’ typically expresses itself in subtle ways. Not obvious to the inexperienced.
						Examples include:</p>

					<p class="lead">
					<ol type="1">
						<li>Hiding from the ball during the game.</li>
						<li>Suddenly kicking the ball away at the sound of the crowd yelling.</li>
						<li>Overwhelmed when under pressure from an opponent and kicking the ball away.</li>
						<li>Easily distracted during a game.</li>
					</ol></p>

					<p class="lead">	
					The primary approach we use to overcome this is a simple ideological substitution. We replace the
						concept of <em>winning</em> with that of <em>improving</em>. By doing this, we alter the players mental
						incentives
						when playing. With no leagues or ladders or tables, the player is freed up to focus on their personal
						player improvement.</p>

					<p>**note: we regularly keep scorelines of activities, exercises, and little games throughout a session.
						Scores are not recorded or kept beyond that segment of the session. They are not celebrated at the
						end of it, either. Rather they are used as a gentle, subtle reminder that the goal of the game, long-
						term, is to score.</p>

						<h1 class="text-dark">Time</h1>
						<p class="lead">There is ongoing debate over the best approach to developing young players in Australia. One
							aspect
							of the debate that is often neglected is the importance of valuing time.</p>

						<p class="lead">
							It is undeniable, one of the lures of the World’s game is its ‘tricky’ nature. The challenges of football
							can only be mastered by one who aims to play with confidence, calmness, and a healthy sense of
							freedom on the field. For that reason, lots of time is required to give young players every chance to
							improve themselves to a level they feel resembles that, with the aim of making the dynamism and
							challenges of the game more enjoyable later in life.
						</p>

						<p class="lead">
							At Foot and Ball Academy, respecting the value of time is a foundation of our teaching philosophy.
							Too often, time is wasted, leading to bad habits. From arriving late to sessions, to the hasty
							introduction of in-game management e.g., kicking the ball out under “pressure.” For this reason, we
							not only stress the importance of punctually, but that every player always feels encouraged to make
							constructive mistakes during a session. i.e., taking risk over ‘safe play.’
						</p>

						<p class="lead"><em>“I would rather see a young player try something they just learnt, make a mistake with it, and
								concede a goal, versus panicking, then booting the ball away, whilst feeling that sense of strategic
								safety. It’s too young for any of that. Leave strategy for later in their life.” - Coach Nick</em></p>
