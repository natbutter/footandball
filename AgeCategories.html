			Whilst we are a young Academy, we do not currently have the infrastructure or 
		        staff to neatly compartmentalise our sessions based on individual age groups or learning ability e.g., U6’s, U7’s, U8’s, U9’s, etc. Therefore, we group them. </p> 
                        
	<p class="lead"> 
			Below is the set of age groups and the learning expectations of each: </p>

	<p class="lead"> <strong>U6’s and U7’s: </strong></p>

	<p class="lead"> 
			This 45-minute session is designed to teach the very basics of the training session and game. Players learn whilst participating in a three-stage session i.e., beginning, middle and end. 
		        The warmup teaches the player to understand how and why they must prepare their bodies before rigorous sport. The middle is normally some fun skill-orientated games 
		        e.g., the popular dribbling game “rob the nest,” which helps us begin to embed the hand-eye-foot coordination skills at that young age. 
		        Finally, we finish the session with 1v1s, making sure the players get as many touches of the ball as possible, through a series of fast, easily resolved match-like mini games. </p>

	<p class="lead"> 
		        Mental aspect: From this early age players are taught to focus on improvement, 
		        repetition in participation (play play play!), and forget about winning and losing! 
		        Concern about the binary outcome of a game is distraction at best and a poison at worst for young minds. </p>

	<p class="lead"> <strong>U7’s and U8’s: </strong></p>
	<p class="lead"> 
                Currently, U7’s is our “cross-over” age. Beginners will start in the 45-minute session, and overtime, progress through time to the 1-hour session. 
		Players with 2+ year exp, and can confidently express the basics e.g., dribbling, weaving, tackling, and some kicking will join this session. 
		All U8’s enrols and start in this session. This age group starts to comprehend the need to learn tricks/tools/techniques to help them in a game. 
		Basic dribbling, weaving, and ball mastery are taught in this age group, with an emphasis on developing the player in the 1v1 environment.  </p>
